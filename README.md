Models of firing neurons in the brain with dynamic coupling to produce complex network synchronisation


This project presents Matlab code to simulate the following cases:
- One firing neuron cell, using three different models: Tau model / Izhkevich Integrate-and-fire model / Exponential model
- A network of x number of firing neurons, coupled together using a dynamic coupling function based on a model of the synapse between neuron cells.

The Docs folder contains sample run configurations and results in a Demo.doc

The figs folder contains result figures from running the Matlab programs.
